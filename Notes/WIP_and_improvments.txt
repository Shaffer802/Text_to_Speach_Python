1. Need to add date and time of the generated file to easily find and store recordings. (DONE)
2. Need to have a feature of outputting both languages at the same time (for customers who want both languages). (DONE)
3. Currently working on exclusion of specified text using '[[excluded text]]' from both Greek and English language and vice versa. (DONE)
4. Better voice (more natural)
5. Make Python script an API with options for web GUI (WIP, proving quite difficult)
6. Make sure there is no text limit (Doesn't seem to have one)
7. Bit rate and PBX compatible (This seems redundant, I wouldn't prioritise it)
